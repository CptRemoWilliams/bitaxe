# Quad Miner Monitor 
BitAxe Quad Mining Monitor Version 1.4.4 (released 1/9/26)
Step 1: Download both files (monitor.html and wallpaper.gif).
Add the favicon.ico file if you want a browser Bitcoin Icon on your tab.
Step 2: Place all files in the same folder together.
Step 3: That's it. The interface now allows you to program in your Bitaxes and saves your sessions. 
(Note ** You can use any webpage on the internet instead of an IP address, but not every webpage is designed to run in an in-line window. Example is having an IP camera if you wanted.)
You can use any wallpaper you want then the one I chose here, just make sure it's called wallpaper.gif, or alter the code in monitor.html to point to your specific choice of wallpaper.
Enjoy!
