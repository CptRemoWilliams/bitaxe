BitAxe Monitor
Step 1: Download both files (Monitor.html and wallpaper.gif) Add the favicon.ico file if you want a browser Bitcoin Icon on your tab. Drop the favicon.ico file in the same folder with the others.
Step 2: Place both files in the same folder together.
Step 3: Edit the Monitor.html file, look specifically for the ip addresses that say 192.168.162.250 and modify each of them to specifically point to each of your Bitaxe ip addresses. 
(You can use any webpage instead of an IP address, but not every webpage is designed to run in an in-line window)
You can use any wallpaper you want, just make sure it's called wallpaper.gif, or alter the code in Monitor.html to point to your specific choice of wallpaper.
Enjoy
